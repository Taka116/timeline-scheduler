# Timeline Builder

This app is an online timeline maker for my university.
Populated by classes scraped from an online sullabus, the app allows users to build their own timeline.
The app is implemented with a muti-search function so it facilitates users to find what they are looking for.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
