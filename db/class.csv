GSSH303L,Social Design & Design Thinking for Urban Change　51,ディマ　クリスティアン,教室未定,金,3,中級科目,2,"Global environmental problems such as climate change, rapid loss of biodiversity and resource depletion have gained prominence on political agendas worldwide, while man-made infrastructure systems and cities have grown more complex and ever more vulnerable. Today’s pervasive, interrelated wicked problems differ significantly in scale and complexity from those of the past that could be addressed, for example, with incremental clean technologies and local policy responses. Today’s new socio-environmental problems require more substantive ‘transitions’ in the coming decades such as major changes in energy, transport, or agri-food systems. These system changes are ‘socio-technical’ because they not only entail new technologies, but also changes in markets, mindsets, user practices, policy and cultural meanings. The emergent domain of Transition Design acknowledges the fact that we live in ‘transitional times’ with permanent change now increasingly seen as ‘the new normal’. Accordingly, transition design takes as its central premise the need for perpetual, socio-envirionmental and socio-technical transitions to more sustainable futures and argues that design thinking has a key role to play in these transitions. It applies an understanding of the interconnectedness of social, economic, political & natural systems to address problems at all levels of spatio-temporal scale in ways that directly improve the quality of life and safeguard human-centred development. It advocates the re-conception of entire lifestyles, with the aim of making them more place-based, convivial & participatory and harmonising them with natural environment.","['試験:', 'レポート:', '70％', 'Mapping and analysis of one selected ‘wicked problem’ and brief sketch of 2 interventions that tackle it at various scales and leverage points.

GSSH302L,Urban Studies,ディマ　クリスティアン,教室未定,水,4,上級科目,4,"The course examines how and why places, plans, and policies are created, shaped, and reshaped by market, bureaucratic, and political influences as well as technologies at a variety of spatial scales - ranging from the neighborhood and community level to the whole city and the region. At the same time the course discusses the different approaches and strategies that planning and governance professionals have been using to accomplish specific goals and objectives and how this in turn is informed by specific institutional, historical and spatial contexts. The course is thus designed to provide students with a broad survey of the history of planning and urban governance practice as well as a review of the central issues in planning and place-making theory. It focuses on the historical development of place-making ideas, the various roles planners and place-makers play in practice, and the ethical dilemmas they face. Emphasis is thus placed on making sense out of theory and practice of how cities are conceptualized, planned, managed, governed, lived-in, appropriated, or contested. Every lecture begins with an outline of larger social theories and then details their implications for the making of cities. We will explore the nature of planning practice and theory from four perspectives:  a) the specific activities associated with planning, place-making, and urban governance, b) the different, often competing perspectives of people who plan, control, manage, and make our cities; c) the relationship between state agencies, place-makers & civil society, and d) plans, policies & resulting urban spaces as artefacts. There are two classroom sessions every week, combined in one 3 hours block. Usually, there will be a lecture at the first session, while the second period is a freer seminar format to be used for student presentations and discussions.","['レポート:', '50％', 'Short research proposal (10％)', 'Annotated bibliography (10％)', 'Final project report (50％)', '平常点評価:', '10％', 'Active participation and regular attendance', 'その他:', '40％', '20％: Mid-term presentation', '20％: Final Presentation']",https://www.wsl.waseda.jp/syllabus/JAA104.php?pKey=210CM40500512018210CM4050021&pLng=jp

People depend on this useful tool so heavily in their everyday lives that most of them would find life without it unimaginable. And yet, they don’t really know how language works or, for that matter, how they acquired their mother tongue in the first place. Indeed, first language acquisition poses an intriguing puzzle. Every normal child easily accomplishes it within a few years without any special training (so the task must be very simple), but even linguists with many years of training can’t duplicate this”simple” feat. There are many mysteries like this about human language, which is why the field of linguistics is fascinating and linguistic research has been very active.Against this backdrop,this course will explain the workings of human language by introducing important theoretical concepts from modern linguistics. More specifically, it will introduce core subfields of linguistics, i.e., phonetics/phonology,morphology/syntax, and semantics/pragmatics. It will thus provide a solid foundation for intermediate-level linguistics courses (and beyond), which will equip students with necessary tools for investigating language and language-related matters. The course will also serve as a good preparation for any discipline that applies knowledge of linguistics.CO202, a companion course that deals with applied linguistics, sociolinguistics and historical linguistics, is offered in the spring semester. Students who are interested in linguistics are strongly encouraged to take this course as well.","['試験:', '100％', 'There will be three exams.

On the basis of the knowledge you have obtained from these introductory courses, this course will investigate mainly the following two things: the internal linguistic development of the English language from a synthetic to an analytic language, i.e. loss of inflections, depending on a more fixed word order, and emerging periphrases and function words such as auxiliaries and prepositions in constructing sentences; and the external influences on the English language throughout its history, namely, lexical borrowings from Greek, Latin (Classical and Medieval), Old Norse, and (Norman-)French words. Accordingly, we shall first study selected features of pronunciation, spelling, and grammar of English from its earliest stage of development. We shall also consider the cultural, social, and political aspects of the external history of English, especially in terms of vocabulary. By the end of the course we will have understood why the English language has become the lingua franca of the world but, for many speakers of it, whether native or non-native, “English is among the easiest languages to speak badly, but the most difficult to use well” (C.

Media scientists analyze social media in order to predict corporate crises, political scientists and economists look for indicators of mood and sentiment in platform speeches and economic forecasts, literary scholars analyze the distribution of motifs in large numbers of texts in different literary epochs, and social historians and sociolinguists look for networks and connections among the people, places, and times related to the documents they study.Following the distinction between “digitized” vs. “digital” scholarship, computers not only assist the work of researchers (digitized scholarship) but also transform the basis of the scholarship: they foster research that would have not been possible without digitization and increasing computing power (digital scholarship). Mapping emotions by mining huge numbers of books, or searching all Latin texts from Antiquity for paraphrases of Plato, are only two examples of investigations documenting the innovative potential of digital research.

Throughout, we will critique the term “culture” in different contexts to examine whether it is a defensible position to justify the activities of different actors. To achieve this, we will need to examine our own position, critique it, then develop a defensible stance that defines and understands culture (and cultures). To do this we will consider how culture is transmitted, how it evolves, the different values it promotes, whether culture has boundaries, and critique the concepts of gender and nationality in culture. Particular focus will be placed upon five topics. (1) Identity, through which we consider how culture/s use tools to create and maintain individual and group identity. (2) Cultural Legitimacy, where the ideas of cultural relativism, consumerism (Pop v Mass) are addressed. (3) Language, through which we consider semiotic values and examine how cultures utilize the media to reinforce values. This will then lead us to (4) Taboo, wherein we will critique real world contemporary examples to consider our values, ethics and morality.

It is especially an opportunity for students who have studied with this instructor to apply their knowledge to specialized individual studies around themes of interest in cultural studies. Adding to what has been discussed in previous courses and seminars with this instructor, this course allows students to work toward a senior thesis project in terms of the intersections between gender/identity/sexuality/culture/region/militarism/tourism/race, etc. to further their understanding of cultural studies, gender studies, and Pacific Studies, and to develop their own individualized projects that cater to their particular interests. Since this is a seminar for advanced students, much of the content will revolve around sharing lively discussion that is of mutual interest to all students, and working together on your independent graduation projects. This seminar is offered in a group discussion-based format, in which students learn from each other at different levels.  All students do shared readings and explore different topics together each semester, and each semester the instructor curates a unique cultural studies/history/gender studies/ethnography theme that we all focus upon.  In general, juniors (3rd year students) help to lead the readings about the main theme and work toward writing a general reflective essay on that theme at the end of the semester; whereas seniors (4th year students) present and teach the seminar about the research that they are doing on their respective topics, with the goal of writing chapters toward their senior thesis due at the end of the year.  Together, we also will pursue group projects and different outreach activities, as well as possible extracurricular activities, based on the proposals of all participants in the seminar.

ADEX101L,Introduction to Architecture,ゴラニ　ソロモン　エレズ,教室未定,月,5,Expression,2,"Throughout the twentieth century, the architecture of the house has been a locus for experimentation with ideas about ways of living, individual expression, and social relation and class. It served as a platform of design trialing for materials and forms, and was the site where architects have sought to offer new domestic lifestyles. From Kenzo Tange and Kazuo Shinohara to Sou Fujimoto and Atelier Bow Wow, nearly all architects of the past hundred years have catalyzed their most elaborated ideas through the design of houses. The house is not simply one type within the architectural vast constructed inventory, but arguably the most important medium for the investigation of architectural ideas.Our window into the field of architecture will be a small, carefully selected group of seminal houses, which were constructed in Japan from the beginning of the 20th Century until the last decade. These works of architecture have an accumulated value. Each of them had the ability to mirror a crystallized image of its social-cultural-political surroundings at the time of construction, and carries extraordinary relevance to the study of the field even today. As a group they form a balanced account of architectural traditions in the modern period and an opportunity for acquaintance with the architectural knowledge of the that period, drawing from a range of fields that influence how a building is designed, described, constructed, with how it is imagined and with how it is used once build.The course will be conducted in a form of a studio. Each of the participating students will be assigned to one project/house. The work during the semester will occur along two paths. In the first, students will conduct a study in relation to ‘their’ particular house, gather material for a ‘box of references’, and gain understanding of its architectural style, its use and structure, its motivation and contextual power. At the second path of the course we will study through practice. In this section each student will construct a series of physical, analytical models of his/her assigned house, getting familiar with design ideas, understanding spatial concerns, considering methods and materials and offering individual interpretations.The course has no prerequisites. Besides an interest in the course subjects, students are not required to have any prior knowledge of architecture. There will be no writing assignment.

Reading texts by female and male authors (Higuchi Ichiyō, Dazai Osamu, Kawabata Yasunari, and others), we analyze how ‘femaleness’ is linguistically enacted and how literature contributes to the common perception of what female language is. We will reflect on how language is linked to the ways ‘the woman’ is constructed and perceived within pre-war Japanese society. These analyses provide an opportunity for discussing notions such as gender and feminism within the context of modern Japanese literature.","['試験:', '30％', 'A short mid-term exam to check your understanding of the course topic.', 'レポート:', '40％', 'A well-researched and properly presented final essay addressing a question of your choice related to the general course topic (minimum 1200 words; detailed information to be announced in class).', '平常点評価:', '30％', 'You need to come to class prepared.

Is it possible to translate one language into another in the fullest sense of the word? Do we need any specific techniques in order to translate books on specialized fields and get some satisfactory results? All these questions are directly connected with the lecturer’s experience as a translator.

The period that this seminar covers in this semester is again from the 1920s when significant silent films were made to the first year of the new millennium when many remarkable films emerged: Wong Kar-wai’s _In the Mood for Love_, Ang Lee’s _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_, Edward Yang (s _A One and a Two_, Christopher Nolan’s _Memento_, Lars von Trier’s _Dancer in the Dark_, and Raoul Ruiz’s _Time Regained_.

Elias actually paid a high regard to literary and artistic expressions of human beings and succeeded in interweaving them with his own innovative social theory. He proved that literature and art are very important weapons for human development or evolution as a unique species as well as technological discoveries.

This is the age of “media convergence,” where content flows across multiple media ecosystems, through multiple media institutions, and into the hands of multiple media audiences. Texts are no longer contained in a single medium, instead spreading from film to webisode to video game (and vice versa). When unified under a single brand, this is often called a “media franchise,” and our goal in this seminar is to unpack how media franchises work on aesthetic, social, technological, industrial, and other cultural levels. This senior seminar will delve into the historical, theoretical, and stylistic aspects of convergence entertainment in its many forms. We will think about how media converge to deliver complex storyworlds through a combination of analyzing theory and practice. Each week, we will look at a different theoretical model of media convergence and examine case studies deriving from film, television, comics, games, toys, and other forms of media representation and participation. Our goal will be to develop a critical understanding of media convergence and media franchise construction through examining how both commercial and grassroots producers collaboratively form large entertainment experiences across a range of media platforms.

Although Western cities too grew immensely during the 19th and early 20th century, the rapid and sudden transformation of Japan from a primarily rural country into one of the world’s most highly urbanized ones was unparalleled until recently. The frantic socio-economic change and urban growth that Japanese cities witnessed during the 1950s and 60s anticipated much of the contemporary urban expansion in rapidly developing countries like China, India, or Brazil. In this context Japan’s experience offers valuable lessons. While Japanese governments and planners borrowed carefully from planning ideas and methods of other advanced countries to respond to swift social and urban change, urban planning, urban governance and cities developed distinctly different in Japan from those of other developed countries. Based on a close reading of André Sorensen’s book ‘The Making of Urban Japan’, the seminar will explore how Japan’s distinctive forms of urbanisation developed over time, which role pre-modern urban forms, traditional urban practices, and a blend of established institutions and newly imported foreign ideas contributed to this.","['レポート:', '60％', '10 short summaries, each no more than 250 - 350 words (6％ each)', '平常点評価:', '10％', 'Active participation', 'その他:', '30％', 'In-class presentations', '備考・関連URL', 'The grades A+ and A are only awared to students, if the weekly chapter summaries meets four out of the six following criteria:・Interpretation of content is completely accurate.・Identifies and describes precise and explicit supporting evidence (facts).・Strongly connects new content to previous learning (elaboration).・Strongly integrates new material to a personal life experience.・Draws an accurate conclusion based upon interpretations, connection, and integration.・Provides a strong reason(s) for the conclusion.']",https://www.wsl.waseda.jp/syllabus/JAA104.php?pKey=210GE10200512018210GE1020021&pLng=jp

In this semester, we will explore landmark Civil Rights events during the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. In addition, we will examine race relations in the U.S. by focusing on African Americans’relations with Japanese Americans and Korean Americans in the postwar period. Finally we will examine the legacy of post civil rights movement and unfinishedwork. We will begin the course by examining the impact of Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. Subsequently,we will examine the March from Selma to Montgomery of 1965, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Dr. King’s Civil Rights Drive in the North of 1996-1967. While examining these events, we will illuminate the diversity of strategies and ideologies within the Civil Rights Movement. In particular, we will explore the radicalization of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and its consequences. Malcolm X was instrumental in this process, and we will contrast his strategies and philosophies with those of Dr. King. The next topic that this course will explore is African Americans’ relations with Japanese Americans and Korean Americans who have greatly benefited from African Americans’ long struggle for civil rights. First, we will briefly examine Japanese experience in the U.S. during World War II and their relationship with African Americans in LosAngles, Seattle, and Chicago. Then, by examining 1992 Los Angeles Riots, we will examine sources of conflicts between African Americans and Korean Americans. Although the Civil Rights Movement brought significant changes to the U.S. and the world, its work remains unfinished. However, the greatest accomplishment of the Civil Rights Movement may be the election of U.S.’s first black president, Barack Obama. We will evaluate his historic campaign and presidency. Lastly, we will discuss the serious issues within the African American community in the 21st century,including 1) the incarceration of large numbers of young black men; 2) the“Black Lives Matter” movement, which emerged in response to the shootings of unarmed African American men by white police officers in St. Louis, Baltimore,and Chicago; and 3) the massacre of nine African Americans by a young white man at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.Although the Civil Rights Movement brought significant changes to the U.S. and the world, its work remains unfinished.

Presentations are to be approximately 20 minutes per student--including time allocated for playing musical selections--and are to touch on the history, geography, and culture from which the music emerged, as well as explaining key musical elements. For example, if the music contains unusual instruments, then the student should introduce those instruments, briefly explaining their history and how they are played. If the rhythms employed are particularly complex, such as with the polyrhythmic music of much of Africa and the Caribbean, then the presenter should explain how those rhythms fit within the overall musical selection.

BSPX102S,First Year Seminar IIB  74,バーレイ　デービッド,教室未定,木,4,基礎演習IIＢ,2,"In this course we will read a novel by a contemporary writer, Lloyd Jones, who was born in 1955 and grew up in New Zealand. In 2007 his sixth novel, Mister Pip (2006), won the Commonwealth Writers’Prize for Best Book from Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. The story is set on the remote island of Bougainville, “where the most unspeakable things happened without once raising the ire of the outside world.” Jones himself reported on the civil war there in the 1990s, and uses this as the setting for his tale. The title of the book, however, is the name of the main character in a different novel, Great Expectations by Charles Dickens (1812-1870), which is set in England in the early nineteenth century. Each book is a coming-of-age story, but in Jones’s tale the main character is a thirteen-year-old girl, who is entranced by Dickens’s novel when she hears it read aloud by her eccentric teacher, Mr Watts, the only white man on the island. There are thus several layers of meaning in this unusual story, which is about the power of imagination as well as about jungle warfare and growing up. It is written in a deceptively simple style, but is a nonetheless a gripping and original piece of fiction.",,https://www.wsl.waseda.jp/syllabus/JAA104.php?pKey=210GE15200742018210GE1520021&pLng=jp

From the 1840s until the 1950s, hundreds of English-language newspapers and magazines were published in Japan, Korea and China. Their readers were not only English-speaking foreigners but the educated elites of East Asia.      In the crisis years of the 1920s and 1930s, the English-language newspapers of East Asia abandoned their focus on news reporting and became vehicles for propaganda.  Writing and publishing far from the battlegrounds of China and Korea, the English-language press fought paper wars over the systemic changes sweeping the region. This seminar is your chance to follow these paper wars in English and to get a close read of the rise and fall of the Japanese empire, the subjugation of Korea, and the Communist victory in the Chinese postwar, 1945-1949 as these events were reported.

In this class we will consider the background to what were real historical events, and then look at parts of the Iliad, which tells the story of the Battle of Troy, to become familiar with the situation. After this we will read a book by the Australian novelist, David Malouf (b. 1934), Ransom (2009), which both tells and reinterprets one part of the Iliad.

The seminar has three main goals: 1) to equip students with a a deeper understanding of the theories and methods (also known as historiography) that underlie historical research, 2) to help students develop a deeper appreciation of what historical research can “do,” that is, the kinds of questions it can answer and the sort of insights it can offer; and 3) to help students choose a viable thesis topic, conduct substantial research on it, and shape that research into a persuasive graduation thesis. How we accomplish these goals will vary from semester to semester depending on enrollment and student interests, but the essential format of the seminar is discussion of assigned readings. What will we read? Typically, we will begin the semester by reading essays and excerpts that relate to Goal #1 above. These readings address questions such as: what is history? how do historians evaluate evidence? what counts as a good historical explanation of an event? Is there such a thing as historical truth?After a few weeks of this we will usually transition to considering Goal #2 above, and this means reading an exemplary historical monograph. Based on the instructor’s suggestions, together we will choose a book that addresses an important and relevant topic, that is interesting and well-written, and that reveals what historical research can do in the hands of a master practitioner. (Usually these books are in the field of modern British, European, or transatlantic history. Recent choices have included Hyperactive: The Controversial History of ADHD by Matthew Smith, Return from the Natives: How Margaret Mead Won the Second World War and Lost the Cold War by Peter Mandler, and Family Secrets: Shame and Privacy in Modern Britain by Deborah Cohen.)Parallel to all of this we will be addressing Goal #3, which means that we will have regular consultations about how to choose and research a thesis topic, how your research is progressing, and how to transform that research into a finished thesis.Believe it or not, while learning all of this we can and will have some fun along the way.

INTA231L,Political and Economic Situations in Southern African Countries,片岡　貞治,教室未定,月,5,中級科目,2,"The principal aim of this course is to provide for the students an introduction of African studies, especially Southern African Countries. While the African continent has significant legal, political and economic challenges, students are rarely introduced to the attempts of African states to set up structures to confront those challenges through regional integration. This course will introduce students to the various legal, political and economic regional integration initiatives on the Southern African region which become an emerging region.Under the powerful influence of South Africa’s significantly accelerating growth, the economic fortunes of Southern Africa as a whole should experience a major boost in 2010. With the region’s dominant economic power finally shaking off some of the heavy burdens of its inherited domestic problems and beginning to forge ahead much more convincingly, most countries in its closest orbit can expect to see positive gains in terms of improved trade and investment flows. However, because Southern Africa is yet some way from being a truly cohesive economic bloc, a few contradictory and negative influences are still at work. These are seen most notably in Zimbabwe’s long-running political and economic meltdown; in Angola’s poor economic management in the midst of its latest oil revenue windfall; and in the persistence of drought and rural distress in Malawi. Most importantly, the overall trends are positive, and at least nine countries have been notching up growth rates in excess of 6％ a year. These include the familiar strong performers, like Botswana and Mauritius, as well as the best practitioners of fundamental economic reform like Mozambique and Zambia. The highest growth rate, Mozambique’s 8.2％ in 2014, may seem to be in a league of its own but in reality reflected no more than the buoyancy of the natural gaz sector. In that connection each ambassadors and embassy officials from the SADC (Southern African Development Community) (http://www.sadc.int/) group will make a presentation on the variety of SADC regions, in terms of the Economy and Politics and relationship between Japan and SADC region during this class. In Japan, there are actually 12 embassies of SADC (Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) (For a moment Mauritius, Seychelles, Swaziland and Comores do not have Embassy in Japan). This SADC group is the biggest one among the African Diplomatic Corps in Tokyo. The course will focus on the geo-political area of southern Africa, and the issues that such regions face as they plan seek to integrate their local economies.","['試験:', '70％', 'Final exam or Final paper', '平常点評価:', '30％', 'Participation, attendance and the quiz', '備考・関連URL', 'Course Requirements:Attendance in class is required, active participation is expected, and students should anticipate being called on to discuss topics.

Usually we don’t consider that, from a Japanese perspective, the Pacific is what connects us to the United States and the rest of the world.  We forget about the Pacific War or about the other ways that the Pacific links Japan to the United States, and instead we just talk about ideas like “the American dream,”“freedom,” fast food, or economic power.

The great Tongan scholar Epeli Hau’ofa called the Pacific Ocean a “Sea of Islands.” By this, he meant that usually we think of the Pacific as a big, empty ocean, but in fact it is filled with thousands of islands that are all connected to each other and that all connect everyone in the world together.

We will also examine major problems facing African states and their citizens. The lectures and discussions will focus on the historical and social legacies that have shaped modern sub-Saharan Africa, and the current social, political and economic circumstances in that region. We will explore early post-independence Africa, the liberation movements, the authoritarian regimes of the late 1960s to the early 1980s, and some important current social, political and economic issues. We will examine how the governments and people in sub-Saharan Africa have responded to these issues and attempt to offer possible routes to a brighter political and economic future. We will try to understand the specificities of the current conflicts in Africa and we will consider how to bring these conflicts to an end and prevent their recurrence.The principal aim of this course is to introduce students to the study of contemporary sub-Saharan African politics and issues. It will expose students to the great diversity of peoples, ideas, cultures, and economic and political systems in this region of the world. In addition, the course will familiarize students with the contemporary social, political and economic issues being debated by analysts of sub-Saharan African politics.

Hopefully through this course students will find a different, more complex reality, a reality where people and countries, like the rest of the world, are struggling with war and peace, authoritarianism and democracy, colonial legacies and current dilemmas, and a reality that calls into question some of the most fundamental beliefs and theories about international relations.In that connection, this course will try to provide an overview of the politics of sub-Saharan Africa and will examine the social, political and economic systems in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We will also examine major problems facing African states and their citizens. The lectures and discussions will focus on the historical and social legacies that have shaped modern sub-Saharan Africa, and the current social, political and economic circumstances in that region. We will explore early post-independence Africa, the liberation movements, the authoritarian regimes of the late 1960s to the early 1980s, and some important current social, political and economic issues. We will examine how the governments and people in sub-Saharan Africa have responded to these issues and attempt to offer possible routes to a brighter political and economic future. We will try to understand the specificities of the current conflicts in Africa and we will consider how to bring these conflicts to an end and prevent their recurrence.The principal aim of this course is to introduce students to the study of contemporary sub-Saharan African politics and issues. It will expose students to the great diversity of peoples, ideas, cultures, and economic and political systems in this region of the world. In addition, the course will familiarize students with the contemporary social, political and economic issues being debated by analysts of sub-Saharan African politics. The course will help students develop a broader knowledge of how politics affect the millions of people living in the region. The Instructor will organise a special lecture with African Diplomatic Coprs in Tokyo within this lecture. Lastly, Japan is organizing its important policy forum on Africa, TICAD (Tokyo International Conference on African Development) since 1993. TICAD Ⅵ was held in Nairobi in 2016. TICAV Ⅶ will be held in Japan in 2019. The instructor will explain the role of Japan for African development.","['試験:', '60％', 'Final Examination', 'レポート:', '20％', 'Map Quiz', '平常点評価:', '20％', 'Participation and Attendance', '備考・関連URL', 'Attendance in class is required, active participation is expected, and students should anticipate being called on to discuss topics.

We will examine these topics in the history of science using themes in contemporary philosophy of science. While the topics of the lectures are structured around episodes and figures in the history of science, each class we will also reflect on how the history of science has been used by philosophers of science to provided examples for the key themes in the philosophy of science, such as the relationship between theory and evidence, the verifiability or falsifiability of theories and the historical contingency of scientific practice.

This revolution began in mid-century and was triggered by Watson and Crick’s discovery of the DNA double helix. Molecular biology, developing out of this discovery, delivered solutions to the problem of how the genetic constitution of a cell and organism determine its appearance and function. Molecular biology is a rich, integrative science that brings together biochemistry, biophysics, genetics, physiology, anatomy, microscopy, computer science, and developmental biology, and it provides insights into the multifaceted story of the birth, life, and death. With this molecular foundation, biotechnology was developed, which enable us to change bio-organisms and to correct the mechanisms underlying many life-threatening conditions including cancer, diabetes and epidemic diseases. Biotechnology, however, is now beginning to alter the social fabric by affecting everyday life not only in the field of agriculture and medicine but also in the area such as criminology, insurance business, energy industry and ethics. The potential to manipulate various life processes by gene modification and animal cloning may pose a danger of unexpected alteration of human destiny.

Therefore, what are the secrets and the essences of success? Students have found that the secret and the essences are connected to Dr. Soetanto’s way of teaching. He is not only teaching but also trying to educe one’s ability（教え育てる）, such as 潜在能力, 教養力 and 人間力 during the classes. Please be noticed that not everyone will be suited and benefited to his unconventional education method, the media calls it as Motivational Education, Soetanto Method (STM), unless you are an open minded learner and challenger who are ready or willing to challenge yourself and sometime even to change yourself.......Hope you are strong enough to challenge this course and the lucky one :) Further detail, please kindly to look the related URLs.

Our daily encounters with and our dependence upon digital technology are often concealed as they take the shape of wireless communication systems such as phones and mobile phone, digital Audio/DVD system, home theater system, video games, cable and satellite digital television, and automobiles and mass transit. This course is organized around the study of digital technological systems, concepts, and processes. Examples of the topics are the Binary system, Boolean Functions, Combinational Logic, Flip-Flops, Counters, and Memory Unit. It is a seminar based on active learning where students are encouraged to work independently and cooperatively, apply design processes, and efficiently use materials and resources to solve problems in a real world context. Technology is not a static body of knowledge; rather, it is dynamic and rapidly changing. Therefore, specific aspects of technology are not drilled to mastery, but rather applied in context to develop decision making skills, and the ability to apply and assess the appropriateness of technologies to the real life.We conduct the class by the Soetanto Method (STM), which is based on motivational education. (Re. text book “Why Do Failure Succeed”, TED Talk and other listed URL)One of the familiar method is the digressional speeches as a means of “the enlightenment of the open mind”, the illuminative effects will also be performed. In order to gain not only the excitement （感動） of academic 科学的(learning digital technology) but also the excitement of the feeling in within (satisfaction and fulfillment 心の奥) when the students grow their Ningen Ryoku （人間力）. During the exercise, we encourage students to study together, helping and caring other.During the class, students will participate in brain training and exercises. You will obtain the joy and excitement of learning. Based on two decades of experience, students have been inspired and motivated to regain their confidence and discover their potential. Throughout this experience students will explore and apply interdisciplinary connections to give relevance and meaning to their education, and to generate life long learning.","['試験:', '40％', 'Final Test.

STSX221L,History of Mathematics　51,シドリ　ネイサン　カミッロ,教室未定,火,3,中級科目,2,"For most of western history, an understanding of mathematical proof was considered essential to a well-rounded education. There is the common story that Abraham Lincoln always carried with him a copy of Euclid’s Elements. Cicero tells us that he sought out the grave of Archimedes, in order to pay tribute to one of the great icons of the intellectual culture he wished to emulate. Neither of these men had any advanced training in mathematics; they were statesmen and orators. They read mathematics because it can compel with a force far beyond that of great speeches. Mathematics is capable of convincing us of things we can all agree upon, and it does this through rigorous proof.This course explores the origins of various types of deductive argumentation by working through the arguments of proofs in a historical context. We will look at the sources of different approaches to mathematical demonstrations in a number of diverse cultures and periods. We focus on the continuous tradition that began in Greece, was adopted by Arabic and Hebrew scholars, and was further cultivated in the Latin west. Finally, we will confront contemporary challenges to the idea of proof such as the delicate relationship between rigor and intelligibility and the possibility of computer generated proofs. Although this is not a mathematics course, you should have some familiarity in mathematics and mathematical ideas. The texts will demand careful attention to the reasoning but they will not require advanced mathematical training. Although it is important to understand the mathematical arguments, we will also pay attention to the text’s historical and philosophical aspects. Each time we meet, we will work through a number of proofs on the board.","['試験:', '50％', 'There are two take-home exams: a midterm, 25％, and the final, 25％.', 'レポート:', '20％', 'There is a graphical assignment, in place of a written paper.', 'その他:', '30％', 'Attendance', '備考・関連URL']",https://www.wsl.waseda.jp/syllabus/JAA104.php?pKey=210MI31400512018210MI3140021&pLng=jp

ARSI281L,Contemporary Issues in the Islamic World,桜井　啓子,教室未定,水,3,中級科目,4,"This course aims to help students in understanding contemporary Islamic resurgence movements in the Middle East and South Asia by focusing on the various types of Islamic movements. Although the geographic expansion of Islam brought diversity in Muslims’interpretation of Islam, Muslims living in today’s globalizing world have confronted common problems, namely coping with modernity and surviving the overwhelming dominance of the West. Various types of Islamic resurgence movements have arisen as a result of the unprecedented challenges from the Western world. The biggest event in the Shi’ite world happened in Iran where the western-oriented dictatorial monarchy had been displaced by the mandate of Islamic jurist through the 1979’s revolution. The success of the Islamic revolution in Iran emboldened the Shi’ite people in the Arab countries as well as in South Asia. The Islamic revivalist activities, both political and non-political, find wide support in Sunni Islamic societies too.

ARSI281L,Contemporary Issues in the Islamic World,桜井　啓子,教室未定,木,3,中級科目,4,"This course aims to help students in understanding contemporary Islamic resurgence movements in the Middle East and South Asia by focusing on the various types of Islamic movements. Although the geographic expansion of Islam brought diversity in Muslims’interpretation of Islam, Muslims living in today’s globalizing world have confronted common problems, namely coping with modernity and surviving the overwhelming dominance of the West. Various types of Islamic resurgence movements have arisen as a result of the unprecedented challenges from the Western world. The biggest event in the Shi’ite world happened in Iran where the western-oriented dictatorial monarchy had been displaced by the mandate of Islamic jurist through the 1979’s revolution. The success of the Islamic revolution in Iran emboldened the Shi’ite people in the Arab countries as well as in South Asia. The Islamic revivalist activities, both political and non-political, find wide support in Sunni Islamic societies too. The Muslim brotherhood in Egypt has won broad support from intellectuals as well as the masses. The growing sectarian conflicts are the chief concern in South Asia where various militant groups have established their footholds.

PHLR21ZL,Religious Thought and Culture -Religion and Violence　51,オルバーグ　ジェレマイア,教室未定,水,5,中級科目,2,"It is a commonplace that religion causes violence. The evidence is obvious: Islamic terrorists, Christians bombing abortion clinics, Hindu violence in India. The list could be extended. At the same time, it is striking how adherents to the various religions claim that violence is foreign to it and those followers who practice violence in the name of religion are almost always immediately disavowed by others. This course goes more deeply into the problem of the relationship between violence and religion through a close reading of one of the foundational texts for the understanding of this relationship - R. Girard’s Violence and the Sacred. We will work through this text, while examining criticisms or developments of Girard’s thought from such people as William Cavanaugh, Luce Irigaray, Sarah Coakley, and John Milbank.","['レポート:', '80％', 'Two thousand word essay on some aspect of the issues discussed in class.', '平常点評価:', '20％', 'Comment sheets.

PHLV381S,Seminar on Philosophy and Religion  53,トレンソン　スティーブン,教室未定,火,2,上級演習,2,"In this seminar we will explore various aspects of Japanese religions. The field of religion in Japan is a vast realm with numerous facets and characteristics, and with branch connections to many other domains of Japanese culture such as art, literature, and philosophy. It comprises different Buddhist schools and currents (Esoteric Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism, Zen, etc.), Shinto beliefs, Chinese traditions, and religious systems that defy any clear classification such as Shugendō (mountain asceticism). All of these schools and systems were once quite influential and, reinforcing each other in a cumulative fashion, have contributed much to the way people have thought about life and death in Japan. Moreover, some of these ways of thinking have survived the test of time and are still considered important today. Doing an in-depth study of the religious thoughts and beliefs developed in Japan is thus quite important to understand the past as well as present-day culture of this area. In this seminar we will read and discuss a number of selected papers and book chapters which are all in some way related to a specific theme. The theme may vary from such topics as “Shinto-Buddhist interactions,” “views of the afterlife,” “religion and the arts,” “religion and gender,” or “religion and philosophy,” depending on the academic term. Occasionally, some classes may be dedicated to student presentations on their thesis topics.",,https://www.wsl.waseda.jp/syllabus/JAA104.php?pKey=210PR50100532018210PR5010021&pLng=jp
